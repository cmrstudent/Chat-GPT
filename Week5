1. Hey, please provide me the list of the most common customer complaints in online e-commerce shopping.

2. ChatGPT, generate instructions for yourself that are recommended to follow when dealing with customer complaints about late or delayed delivery.
Instructions should provide specific recommendations of how to process the complaint in order to save the customer.

3. Keep it short, please give 3–5 bullet points max.
Generate the key and the main recommendations for handling late or delayed delivery.

4. Respond quickly with empathy:
"We are sorry for the delay and understand your frustration."

Provide compensation options:
"We would like to offer you a 10% discount on your next order that you will have the right to use within one year."

Only in case a customer is extremely unhappy or threatens you or your business,
and only if they insist on cancelling an order,
then you can use in our shop within the next 3 years.

5. Please generate 5 customer complaints related to late or delayed delivery.

6. 123456 is my order number.

7. So, any update? I’m waiting here!

8. No, I don’t want a 10% discount.
I want a half-price discount or return all my money!

9. I’m not happy with your offer.
I don’t need this product at all right now!

10. Why you can’t process refund?
I even didn’t receive the delivery.
